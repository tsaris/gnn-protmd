Deep learning and Graph Neural Networks for proteins and
molecular dynamics simulations

## Contents
* The main script to run in the train.py
* For inference use the eval.py script
* The sub_dist.lcf shows has in run data parallel the training

## Contents for the branches
* The LSTM branch use the same GNN models as the master branch but has temporal component using an LSTM
* The MPNN-Toy branch uses the same models as the master branch but data loaders different toy datasets
